### [Strategitica](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica) Changelog

## 1.4.0 (10 May, 2021)

* [#48](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/48) resolved - Task duration and time of day now appear like other task attributes. The tags associated with them will still show up with the rest of the task's tags.
* [#53](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/53) resolved - Dailies with weekly recurrence that have no days of the week selected will no longer show in the calendar.

## 1.3.1 (6 May, 2021)

* [#44](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/44) resolved - Some user/task attributes weren't being handled correctly in terms of data types, which caused Strategitica to hang for some users.


## 1.3.0 (27 April, 2021)

* [#36](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/36) resolved - The default number of days that will be shown in the calendar has been reduced to 90 from 186, and the days URL parameter has been added. For example, add ?days=30 to the Strategitica URL to show 30 days in the future. The maximum days allowed is 180, so any number above that will cause Strategitica to show 180 days in the future.
* Added logging capabilities for debugging purposes. See https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica#debugging

## 1.2.1 (21 February, 2021)

* [#16](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/16) resolved - mage class should now show correctly (instead of wizard)

This change is in [pull request #38](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/pull/38).

## 1.2.0 (21 February, 2021)

* [#29](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/29) resolved - emoji shortcodes are now supported

This change is in [pull request #34](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/pull/34).

## 1.1.0 (15 February, 2021)

* [#19](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/19) resolved - To-do's now show in the calendar
* [#20](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/issues/20) resolved - All dailies' recurring due dates now show in the calendar, with a few potential limitations:
  - If a daily has a due date in the past, there's a chance it'll get placed at a date slightly off from when it should actually appear. This is because when a due date is in the past, Strategitica will use Habitica's API to find the next due date, and sometimes, for reasons unknown, that date is wrong. For example, If a daily's start date is on April 11th, 2020, and it's due every 12 months on that day of the month. In February 2021, that task should show up on April 11th, 2021. For some reason though, the Habitica API comes back with April 10th, 2021 as the earliest "next due" date. So basically, Strategitica sees April 10th, 2021 as the first date for this task, and it also sees that it should show up on April 11th, 2021 as well, so it adds both dates to the calendar. Not sure if there's much I can do about this.
  - If a daily is set to repeat monthly on a day of the month that doesn't exist for some month (e.g. on the 30th, but there's no 30th in February), that daily won't show up in that month, although Habitica will consider it due on the last day of that month. The one exception is if it's set to repeat on the 31st. Then, Strategitica will understand it should be due on the last day of the month. Unsure if anything can be done about this.

Changes above are in [pull request #27](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/pull/27).

## 1.0.2 (11 February, 2021)

* Reorganized JS a lot by switching to Node modules
* Other readme updates

Changes above are in [pull request #26](https://github.com/iymeko/strategitica/pull/21). Also:
